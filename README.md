# cchat
Practice network programming

The plan:
 - A server application, that hosts exactly one chat room and accepts connections
 - A client application, that connects to the chat
 - TUI for a client application, fully keyboard driven
 - No authentication - anyone can enter anonymously or with a username as long as it is not acquired at the moment
